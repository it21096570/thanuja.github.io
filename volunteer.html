                    <p>
                        Volunteering is an incredibly rewarding and fulfilling experience that allows individuals to
                        make a positive impact on their communities and the lives of others. As a volunteer, I have had
                        the opportunity to contribute my time and skills to various organizations and causes, and it has
                        been an enriching journey.<br /><br />

                        One of my most significant volunteer experiences was working with a local non-profit
                        organization that focused on providing education and support to underprivileged children. In
                        this role, I helped facilitate after-school programs, tutoring sessions, and educational
                        workshops. It was incredibly inspiring to witness the enthusiasm and eagerness of these children
                        to learn and succeed despite the challenges they faced. Being able to contribute to their
                        educational growth and seeing their progress was immensely gratifying.

                            As a Graphic Designer volunteer for the Central Initiative for Astronomical Studies (CIAS),
                            I worked to support the organization's mission of advancing astronomical education. In this
                            role, I was responsible for creating visually engaging graphics for various print and
                            digital media such as event posters, brochures, and social media posts.<br /><br />

                            Some of my key responsibilities included:<br /><br />

                            Collaborating with the CIAS team to design graphics that promote events, initiatives, and
                            educational programs.<br />

                            Designing marketing materials such as flyers, brochures, and business cards.<br /><br />

                            Contributing to the development and maintenance of CIAS's visual identity and design
                            system.<br /><br />

                            Through my volunteer work, I had the opportunity to contribute to CIAS's efforts to promote
                            astronomical education. I was able to create graphics that helped to promote events and
                            initiatives, raise awareness about astronomical research, and engage the public in the
                            organization's mission. Additionally, I gained valuable experience in design software such
                            as Adobe Photoshop and in collaborating with a team to bring creative projects to
                            fruition.<br /><br />

                            I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked with such a dedicated and passionate
                            organization and to have been a part of promoting astronomical research and education.

                            Observation astronomy and rocketry are fascinating fields that explore the mysteries of the
                            universe and our ability to reach beyond our planet. Observation astronomy involves studying
                            celestial objects and phenomena using telescopes and other instruments, unraveling the
                            secrets of distant galaxies, stars, and planets. It allows us to understand the origins of
                            the universe and our place within it. Rocketry, on the other hand, focuses on the design,
                            construction, and launch of rockets into space. It enables us to explore space, conduct
                            scientific experiments, and even envision future space travel and colonization. Both
                            observation astronomy and rocketry open doors to endless possibilities, expanding our
                            knowledge and igniting our curiosity about the vastness of the cosmos.

                            The Foundation Stone of Sasnaka Sansada was laid in 1997 by a group of young individuals who
                            were gathered to the Sri Sudassanarama Temple in Battaramulla, who subsequently got involved
                            with a number of socio-religious activities with the involvement of the villages and other
                            well wishers.The initial deliberations of Sasnaka Sansada aimed to inculcate Buddhist
                            spiritual essence among the younger generation who were in the membership and get their
                            involvement in the social and community acts.<br />

                            After the initiation, Sasnaka Sansada expanded its activities to the other region and parts
                            of the island.First of such activity was at a very rural school in Ratnapura District where
                            the foundation provided educational aids to school children and spent the entire day with
                            them educating and inspiring those children with social events.Many books, stationary items,
                            school items, clothes, shoes and other collected items were distributed among the
                            students.<br />
