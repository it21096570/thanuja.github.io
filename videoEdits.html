                    <h2><a href="#">Video Edits</Video><br /></a></h2>
                    <p>Hey fellow video editing enthusiasts! Let's take a moment to talk about the incredible world of
                        video editing. As a video editor,
                        I am constantly amazed by the power of storytelling through visuals and motion. It's like
                        painting with frames and sequences,
                        crafting emotions and narratives that captivate audiences. From cutting and splicing footage to
                        adding effects and music,
                        every edit has the potential to evoke a specific mood or convey a powerful message. The creative
                        possibilities are endless,
                        and that's what excites me the most. Whether it's a short film, a music video, or a promotional
                        piece, each project presents a unique
                        challenge and an opportunity to bring ideas to life. So, fellow editors, let's keep exploring,
                        experimenting, and pushing the boundaries of
                        visual storytelling.
                        Together, we can create cinematic masterpieces that leave a lasting impact. Keep editing and let
                        your creativity shine!

                <p style="font-size: 12px;">The Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic is a world-renowned place of worship,
                    where the left Canine tooth of Gautama Buddha is enshrined. The temple which is venerated by
                    thousands of local & foreign devotees and tourists daily was named as a world heritage by UNESCO in
                    1988.

                    The temple which carries a lot of value to Buddhists all over the world also has immense cultural
                    value. The architecture is of unique Kandyan architectural style with a combination of the unique
                    style used to build “Dalada Mandira” the shrines which housed the Sacred Tooth Relic previously in
                    other kingdoms.

                    CIAS was established in 2017 by alumni of several schools in Kandy who were passionate about
                    astronomy.
                    For two years the organization was successfully carrying out its activities to encourage school
                    students to learn astronomy and help them improve their knowledge for the subject, before taking a
                    break from the activities in 2019 due to the pandemic and ongoing crisis in the country.
                    Again on July 23, 2022 the club was reactivated with new members to continue the activities of the
                    organization and achieve its goals.
                    With our group of dedicated and supportive members, our mission is to succeed each and every
                    endeavours we wish to be fulfilled.
